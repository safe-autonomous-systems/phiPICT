    """Register a ``Hook.PRE`` callback setting ``block.viscosity = nu_SGS + nu``.

    The eddy viscosity is recomputed from the current velocity field before the
    momentum matrix is assembled, and added to the molecular viscosity per cell.
    It affects momentum only; passive scalars keep their molecular diffusivity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    prep_fn: Hooks or dict[str, Any]
        The hooks (or legacy callback dict) to append to. Modified in place.

    model: SGSModel
        The sub-grid-scale model. ``"none"`` registers nothing.

    coefficient: float
        The model coefficient. The conventions differ per model and are *not*
        interchangeable: ``"smagorinsky"`` expects ``C_s**2``, while ``"wale"``
        expects the textbook ``Cw`` (~0.325-0.5), which the extension squares
        internally.

    ndims: int
        Number of spatial dimensions. ``"wale"`` requires 3.

    dtype: torch.dtype
        Dtype of the domain; the coefficient tensor must match it.

    cuda_device: torch.device
        The CUDA device the simulation runs on.

    cpu_device: torch.device | None
        Device for the coefficient tensor, which the extension requires on the
        host. Defaults to CPU.

    scale_sqr: list[torch.Tensor] | None
        Optional per-block multiplicative damping field applied to nu_SGS before
        the molecular viscosity is added (e.g. squared van Driest for a channel).
