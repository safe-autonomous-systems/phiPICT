"""Telemetry for the linear solves.

Every solve in the codebase funnels through
``piso_diff._linear_solve_wrapper``, and the CUDA kernels already return a
``LinearSolverResultInfo`` per right-hand side with the final residual, the
iteration count and a converged flag. Until now that information was discarded
unless the solve failed, so there was no way to tell how hard the pressure or the
electric-potential solve was actually working -- or how close it was running to
``max_iter``.

This module adds an opt-in sink. When no recorder is active nothing is computed
and nothing is allocated, so the RL inner loop is unaffected.

The residuals are worth reading as physics, not just as solver bookkeeping:

* the pressure residual is the mass-conservation error of the projection;
* the electric-potential residual is the charge-conservation error. The
  face-based current density is built so that ``div J`` equals the epot Poisson
  residual (see ``mhd_simulation.add_lorentz_force``), so an under-converged
  potential solve feeds a spurious Lorentz force back into the momentum equation.
